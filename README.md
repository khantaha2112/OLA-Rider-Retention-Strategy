<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project analyzes **100,000 rows** of OLA ride-hailing data to evaluate key operational metrics, including booking success rates, cancellation causes, and vehicle performance. The insights derived from this analysis are used to formulate a data-driven strategy aimed at significantly improving both **rider and driver retention**.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="🛑 The Core Business Problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

High cancellation rates (both customer and driver-initiated) and inconsistent service quality directly impact OLA's revenue and market share. The analysis aims to address the following pain points::
- **Revenue Leakage:** Unsuccessful bookings (cancellations and incomplete rides) result in lost revenue opportunities.
- **Customer Churn:** Frequent or unexplained cancellations lead to customer dissatisfaction and a high probability of customers switching to competitors.
- **Driver Dissatisfaction:** Inefficient routing, low ratings, or unfair cancellation penalties can lead to driver churn, reducing the overall fleet supply.
- **ISub-optimal Fleet Performance:** Lack of clarity on which vehicle types (e.g., Mini, Sedan, Prime) are most profitable or efficient prevents optimized resource allocation and pricing.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="🔎Key Analytical Areas Addressed by the OLA Project"></a>Key Analytical Areas </h2>

High cancellation rates (both customer and driver-initiated) and inconsistent service quality directly impact OLA's revenue and market share. The analysis aims to address the following pain points::
- **💰 Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluation of historical booking patterns (Ride Volume and Total Booking Value) to understand overall revenue health and growth.
- **🚗 Vehicle Type Performance:** Analysis of vehicle-specific metrics (performance, distance, and booking value impact) to optimize fleet utilization and pricing.
- **❌ Cancellation Analysis:** Pinpointing the primary reasons for customer and driver-initiated cancellations to identify friction points and reduce revenue l
- **⭐ Ratings and Quality Analysis:** Comparing Customer and Driver ratings to diagnose service quality gaps and target specific areas for improvement.
- **🌍 Geospatial & Time-Series Dependency:** Investigation of ride demand, cancellation spikes, and successful bookings across different geographic regions and time-based factors (e.g., peak hours, weekends, seasonal weather).
